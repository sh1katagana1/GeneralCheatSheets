# Web Proxies
A lot of times you may be doing a Purple/Red team and your company's web content filter is blocking certain sites. It is useful for testers to have a refreshing list of web proxies to bypass these and test the detection capabilities of the tooling

## Holy Unblocker
One of the more popular ones is something called Holy Unblocker https://holyubofficial.net/ 
You will note that if you go to the proxy page https://holyubofficial.net/proxy.html its saying you need to go to the Titanium Network Discord channel to get the proxy https://discord.gg/CwWpdGkuWY
Once you joined the Discord channel, look at the list of rooms and go to the "bots" room. From there type in /proxy. This will ask you for a service, to which you start typing Holy Unblocker and it will come up for you to click. 
When I did that, it said the link to my proxy was colpsk12.org
This will be the proxy site, and you should be able to put banned sites in the search and be able to access them.
